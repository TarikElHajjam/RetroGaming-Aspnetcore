A CRUD web application with validation, identity server and much more! The backend is developed by me and for the frontend I used a template which I heavily edited, the credit for the template can be found in the Layout. This is my first ever web application, more would come in the near future! Built using Asp.net core 3.1 MVC, Bootsrap, Entity Framework core, AWS and javascript Visit my web application at: http://retrogamer-dev.us-east-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/
